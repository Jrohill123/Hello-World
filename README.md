# Hello-World
This is my first project on Github which is a simple Hello World. At the time I started this project I was a somphmore in College.

How are you guys doing!!!! My Name is Jordan Rohilliard and I am an upcoming Software Engineer/Mogul/Bussinessman/Producer

The opportunities on here will give me much needed expirence for this area of my life and thats exactly what I need.
